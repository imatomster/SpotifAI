# Description
## üî® How I built it
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Dash
- Spotify API

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I did
- Constructed an app with a Dash interface that allows users to input at least 5 favorite songs & in turn create custom target playlists catered for the user 
- Extracted user input searches from the Spotify API into a Pandas DataFrame that contains song traits to be spliced, filtered, and fed to ML models 
- Trained models with sklearn to execute algorithms that learn what songs the user likes based on the danceability, acousticness, energy, etc of the songs
